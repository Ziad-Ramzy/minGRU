# MinGRU Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of a 2-layer Minimal Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) model based on the 'Were RNNs All We Needed?' paper model from scratch. The purpose of this implementation is to provide a clear and concise understanding of the minGRU architecture, focusing on its key components and functionalities.
